Mobile OSM House Number Editor
==============================

Add house number information to an incompletely mapped area of the [Open Street Map] [1] (OSM) from mobile devices.

OSM is a free (as in free speech) world-wide map which is build from spontaneous contributions. There are no limits to the information which can be added to the map and new features can be proposed by contributors.
The [addr:housenumber tag] [2] is part of the standard OSM features.
