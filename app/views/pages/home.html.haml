  #no-map-warning
    %p Hello! The display you're using doesn't have any map. Please do notice that smartphones and tablets geolocation abilities use to be limited. In case you wish, you can acceed to the preview map by viewing this <abbr title="application">app</abbr> in a wider screen. In case you don't, please be sure of double checking your house numbers coordinates before you submit them to the map, for example, by using a dedicated <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> device. You've been warned, just enjoy mapping!

      %h1 <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>
      %p OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project built to provide <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org">free geographic data and mapping</a> to anyone who wants it. It started because most maps you think of as free actually have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive, or unexpected ways.
      %p This application is a way among others to edit that map. <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ILOE">Some</a> allow you to submit any <em>point of interest</em>, <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM">others</a> give you full access to add map features. We believe in keeping things simple, and our contribution consits in giving you a handy tool to number buildings while you're on the go.
